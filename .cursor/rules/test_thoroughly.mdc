# ðŸ§ª THOROUGH TESTING RULE

## CRITICAL: ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS RULE

**BEFORE claiming anything works:**

1. **NEVER say "âœ… PERFEKT!" or "âœ… FUNKTIONIERT!" without thorough testing**
2. **ALWAYS verify the complete output** - not just the first few lines
3. **ALWAYS check actual email content** - not just terminal logs
4. **ALWAYS compare expected vs actual results**
5. **ALWAYS test both morning and evening reports**
6. **ALWAYS verify debug output is complete** - not truncated
7. **ALWAYS check all sections are present** (NIGHT, DAY, RAIN, WIND, GUST, THUNDERSTORM, etc.)

## TESTING CHECKLIST

**Before claiming success, verify:**

- [ ] Result output is correct format
- [ ] Debug output is complete (not truncated)
- [ ] All weather sections are present
- [ ] Both morning and evening reports work
- [ ] Email content matches expectations
- [ ] No error messages in output
- [ ] All data is properly formatted

## FAILURE TO FOLLOW = IMMEDIATE CORRECTION

**If I violate this rule:**
- Immediately admit the mistake
- Do NOT make excuses
- Fix the problem systematically
- Test again thoroughly

## NO EXCEPTIONS

**This rule applies to ALL claims about functionality working.**
**No shortcuts. No assumptions. No premature success claims.**
